## Introduction
The goal of the project is to use as little code as possible to generate insight from scraped data

## Scope
The scraped data can be found on *gutunberg's* archive of books on python's *nlt*. It is G.K. Chesterson's nightmarish and suspensful mystery, The Man Who Was Thursday. 

## Methodology
Nltk's *punkt* tokenizer was used to tokenize the book into tokens before words were extracted. Stopwords were segregated from words which did not have stop words. Matplotlib's word cloud was used to visualize most occurring words in the set of words without stop words

## Conclusion
The word cloud revealed the following words that the most occurrence in G.K. Chesterson's The Man Who Was Thursday:

>syme
>man
>said
>face
>one
>thing
>seemed
>etc.
